## Hi, I'm Mia Jerphagnon 👋

I’m a Project Coordinator at Quartic Solutions, a GIS firm supporting large-scale public sector initiatives. I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Business Economics and a Minor in Data Science, and I’m passionate about using data to support projects with real-world impact.

My background sits at the intersection of project management, data analysis, and public-sector work. I’ve previously interned with the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the Data Science Alliance, and the County of San Diego’s Office of Evaluation, Performance, and Analytics, where I worked on data-driven initiatives to support decision-making and policy.

Technically, I work primarily in Python, with experience in Tableau and SQL, and a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data visualization.

But coding isn’t the only language I speak — I’m also fluent in French 🇫🇷.

One project I’m especially proud of is a grant-funded research study on CalFresh access at UCSD. What began as a small personal project in college has grown into a multi-wave study analyzing enrollment patterns and barriers to access. We’re currently in our third wave of data collection, continuing to explore how data can inform more equitable resource distribution.

Below, you’ll find a mix of academic, professional, and personal projects. Feel free to explore — and thanks for stopping by!
